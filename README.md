This is a modified program from some of my most popular [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@lenpai0) buzzer video. This code should work for any Arduino board. It is made with intention for ease of use and entertainment.

## How to make
You will need a **passive** buzzer/speaker. This will not work for an active buzzer. This is an excellent guide on the key difference and methods to use to tell what buzzer you have as you cannot tell by simply looking at one. https://circuitdigest.com/microcontroller-projects/understanding-difference-between-active-and-passive-buzzer-with-arduino

### Schematic 
This program uses pin 8 as the buzzer pin but it can be changed to any other GPIO pins.

Pay attention if your buzzer has polarity (+ mark at the top). If it does, make sure that the '+' side pin is connected to Arduino pin. Otherwise, then it doesn't which pin goes where.
